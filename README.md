ast = some_code.to_ast
# => #<Rubinius::AST::LocalVariableAssignment:0x21b8
#       @value=#<Rubinius::AST::FixnumLiteral:0x21bc @value=123 @line=1>
#       @variable=nil @line=1 @name=:a>

Contributing
-------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or version
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
